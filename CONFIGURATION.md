# Sonic Configuration

## Configuration sources

Sonic looks for its configuration as [TOML] in `./config.cfg`, or whatever you
passed via `--config`/`-c`.

This file is optional, as all configuration keys can be defined using
`SONIC_` environment variables (which take precedence over the static
configuration). The path separator is `__`, which means `foo.bar.baz` will be
read from `SONIC_FOO__BAR__BAZ`.

## Configuration keys reference

**All available configuration options are commented below, with allowed values:**

### Server configuration

Under `[server]`:

* `log_level` (type: _string_, allowed: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, default: `error`) — Verbosity of logging, set it to `error` in production

### Channel configuration

Under `[channel]`:

* `inet` (type: _string_, allowed: IPv4 / IPv6 + port, default: `[::1]:1491`) — Host and TCP port Sonic Channel should listen on
* `tcp_timeout` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `300`) — Timeout of idle/dead client connections to Sonic Channel
* `bulk_buffer_size` (type: _integer_, allowed: bytes greater than or equal to `20000`, default: `8388608`) — Maximum authenticated `UPSERTBATCH` command size; ordinary commands remain limited to 20 KB
* `auth_password` (type: _string_, allowed: password values, default: none) — Authentication password required to connect to the channel (optional but recommended)

`channel.search` has been deprecated in favor of `search`, but it’s kept as an alias for
backward compatibility reasons.

### Normalization configuration

Warning: After making changes to normalization steps, you must rebuild Sonic’s
index by re-ingesting all data. To avoid such breaking change, new features are
disabled by default (opt-in). On major releases, some steps might become
enabled by default (opt-out). Sonic won’t enable unreasonable defaults, but
override if you need consistency.

Under `[normalization]`:

* `diacritic_folding_enabled` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `false`) — Whether to enable [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) folding or not (it reduces the index size and improves results)
* `stemming_enabled` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `false`) — Whether to enable [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) or not (it avoids losing non-flushed data in case of server crash)
  * Warning: Enabling stemming greatly affects the quality of Sonic results. Enable only if you have a good reason to.

### Tokenization configuration

Warning: After making changes to tokenization steps, you must rebuild Sonic’s
index by re-ingesting all data. To avoid such breaking change, new features are
disabled by default (opt-in). On major releases, some steps might become
enabled by default (opt-out). Sonic won’t enable unreasonable defaults, but
override if you need consistency.

Under `[tokenization]`:

* `detect_special_patterns` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `true`) — Whether the tokenizer should detect special patterns or not
  * Sonic does fuzzy matching by default. However, some search terms are
    usually expected to match exactly, like email addresses. To support this
    use case, Sonic detects common patterns (e.g. email addresses, phone
    numbers, UUIDs, etc. and ensures they are both not split by the tokenizer
    (unless `tokenization.compat_split_special_patterns = true`) and matched
    exactly in queries.
  * For more information, see [docs/tokenizer-pattern-matching.md](./docs/tokenizer-pattern-matching.md).
  * This feature adds negligible overhead, you should probably not disable it.
* `compat_split_special_patterns` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `true`) — Whether the tokenizer should split special patterns or not
  * Special patterns are matched exactly when performing a query. However,
    doing so without rebuilding your Sonic index breaks queries with special
    patterns. This flag enables a compatibility feature that integrates with an
    existing inex (at the cost of potentially worse results).
  * For more information, see [docs/tokenizer-pattern-matching.md](./docs/tokenizer-pattern-matching.md).
  * You don’t need to rebuild your Sonic index if you use
    `tokenization.compat_split_special_patterns = true` (default).
  * If you can easily rebuild your Sonic index and sometimes query things like
    email addresses, phone numbers or identifiers, it is recommended that you
    disable this feature.

### Search configuration

Under `[search]`:

* `query_limit_default` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `10`) — Default search results limit for a query command (if the LIMIT command modifier is not used when issuing a QUERY command)
* `query_limit_maximum` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `100`) — Maximum search results limit for a query command (if the LIMIT command modifier is being used when issuing a QUERY command)
* `query_alternates_try` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `4`) — Number of alternate words that look like query word to try if there are not enough query results (if zero, no alternate will be tried; if too high there may be a noticeable performance penalty)
* `query_candidates_maximum` (type: _integer_, allowed: positive numbers, default: `1000`) — Candidate scoring budget for a query; deeper pagination raises this budget to include the requested page
* `list_limit_default` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `100`) — Default listed words limit for a list command (if the LIMIT command modifier is not used when issuing a LIST command)
* `list_limit_maximum` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `500`) — Maximum listed words limit for a list command (if the LIMIT command modifier is being used when issuing a LIST command)

### KV store configuration

Under `[store.kv]`:

The collection RocksDB stores metadata, postings and document column families. Active levels
use LZ4 and the bottommost level uses Zstandard when `database.compress` is enabled. UPSERT
payloads are limited to 14,000 encoded bytes and must also fit within the Sonic
Channel line buffer.

* `path` (type: _string_, allowed: UNIX path, default: `./data/store/kv/`) — Path to the Key-Value database store

* `pool.inactive_after` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `1800`) — Time after which a cached database is considered inactive and can be closed (if it is not used, ie. re-activated)

* `database.flush_after` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `900`) — Time after which pending database updates should be flushed from memory to disk (increase this delay if you encounter high-CPU usage issues when a flush task kicks-in; this value should be lower than `store.kv.pool.inactive_after`)
* `database.compress` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `true`) — Whether to compress database or not (uses LZ4 for active levels and Zstandard for the bottommost level)
* `database.parallelism` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `2`) — Limit on the number of compaction and flush threads that can run at the same time
* `database.max_files` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, no default) — Maximum number of database files kept open at the same time per-database (if any; otherwise there are no limits)
* `database.max_compactions` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `1`) — Limit on the number of concurrent database compaction jobs
* `database.max_flushes` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `1`) — Limit on the number of concurrent database flush jobs
* `database.write_buffer` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `16384`) — Maximum size in KB of the database write buffer, after which data gets flushed to disk (ie. `16384` is `16MB`; the size should be a multiple of `1024`, eg. `128 * 1024 = 131072` for `128MB`)
* `database.write_ahead_log` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `true`) — Whether to enable Write-Ahead Log or not (it avoids losing non-flushed data in case of server crash)

### FST store configuration

Under `[store.fst]`:

* `path` (type: _string_, allowed: UNIX path, default: `./data/store/fst/`) — Path to the Finite-State Transducer database store

* `pool.inactive_after` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `300`) — Time after which a cached graph is considered inactive and can be closed (if it is not used, ie. re-activated)

* `graph.consolidate_after` (type: _integer_, allowed: seconds, default: `180`) — Time after which a graph that has pending updates should be consolidated (increase this delay if you encounter high-CPU usage issues when a consolidation task kicks-in; this value should be lower than `store.fst.pool.inactive_after`)
* `graph.max_size` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `2048`) — Approximate maximum size in KB of the adaptive typo-correction lexicon
* `graph.max_words` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `250000`) — Maximum number of frequent terms retained in the adaptive typo-correction lexicon
* `graph.min_frequency` (type: _integer_, allowed: numbers, default: `2`) — Minimum number of indexed objects containing a term before it becomes eligible for the adaptive typo-correction lexicon

## Environment variables interpolation

Some configuration keys —namely `server.log_level`, `channel.inet`,
`channel.auth_password`, `store.kv.path` and `store.fst.path`— support
environment variable interpolation. If you set `"${env.SECRET}"` for one of
those keys, the value will be expanded from the `SECRET` environment variable.
